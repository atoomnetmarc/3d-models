This contraption holds a large 2.3kg filament spool. 4kg or 1kg spools should also work.

Put some 20mm wide wire harness tape on the curved edges of the slider block where the spool rests on. This will give a smooth screechless motion when unspooling during printing.

Connect all the pieces with M3x10 (or x8 or x14, does not matter that much).

Finish with putting some sticky or slide pads on the bottom corners.
