This thing hold a Lenovo P15v laptop.

Print parts in any orientation you see fit. Your printer needs to be able to print 200mm Z. All parts except both Upper-connectors print standing up. Use brim if parts fall over during print. I printed mine in PLA.

Use 28 (or so) M3x15 (or x20 does not matter that much) screws to assemble.

Stick some 15mm wide automotive cloth wrapping tape on upper connectors where the front of the laptop rests against to prevent scratches.

Stick 4 sticky or slide pads on the bottom 4 corners to prevent scratching your desk.
