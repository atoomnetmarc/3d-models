This contraption holds a 1kg (or 750gr) filament spool. I printed it on my Voron V0.1 that has a tiny 120mm x 120mm print bed. The largest piece fits exactly when turning off the skirt or brim in your slicer.

Put some 20mm wide wire harness tape on the curved edges of the slider block where the spool rests on. This will give a smooth screechless motion when unspooling during printing.

Connect all the pieces with M3x10 (or x8 or x14, does not matter that much).

Finish with putting some sticky or slide pads on the bottom corners.
