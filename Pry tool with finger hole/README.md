This is a pry tool with finger hole with some subtile serrations. It will be used to pry an ABS cover plate of my car.

Print in plastic softer than the plastic you are going to pry. I printed mine on my Voron V0.1 in ASA.

Print one at a time and as many as you have hands. Statistically that number would round up to 2.
You may want to print with 2mm wall thickness for extra strength.
